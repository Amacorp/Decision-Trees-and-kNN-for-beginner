# Decision-Trees-and-kNN-for-beginner

We begin our overview of classification and regression methods with one of the most popular ones â€“ a decision tree. Decision trees are used in everyday life decisions, not just in machine learning. Flow diagrams are actually visual representations of decision trees. For example, Higher School of Economics publishes information diagrams to make the lives of its employees easier.

In terms of machine learning, one can see it as a simple classifier that determines the appropriate form of publication (book, article, chapter of the book, preprint, publication in the "Higher School of Economics and the Media") based on the content (book, pamphlet, paper), type of journal, original publication type (scientific journal, proceedings), etc.

A decision tree is often a generalization of the experts' experience, a means of sharing knowledge of a particular process. For example, before the introduction of scalable machine learning algorithms, the credit scoring task in the banking sector was solved by experts. The decision to grant a loan was made on the basis of some intuitively (or empirically) derived rules that could be represented as a decision tree.
